Hello! I’m <strong>Nikhil Gupta</strong>, an aspiring <strong>Data Analyst</strong> who is deeply passionate about uncovering insights from data and using them to support impactful decision-making. I specialize in tools like SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI, and I enjoy transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable narratives. My journey into data analysis wasn’t a conventional one—but that’s exactly what makes it meaningful.</p>

<p>I completed my schooling at Deepanshu Public School, Delhi, scoring <strong> 85% in my 12th board exams </strong> from a commerce background, and recently earned my <strong> Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University – School of Open Learning</strong>. While my academic journey has been rooted in commerce, I’ve always had a strong affinity for technology. From a young age, I was naturally drawn to computers—exploring software, learning tools on my own, and developing strong digital skills. Over time, that early curiosity evolved into a deeper interest in how data shapes the world around us, eventually leading me to pursue a career in data analytics.</p>

<p>Throughout my learning journey, I’ve dedicated myself to building strong analytical and technical skills. I’ve completed personal projects that showcase real-world data analysis—from visualizing music listening patterns with Power BI, to analyzing job market trends and salaries using Excel, to working with Python and SQL for data wrangling and exploration. These projects not only reflect my growing technical abilities but also my love for storytelling through data.</p>

<p>But there’s another side of me too—a creative one. I’m also a <strong>professional popping dancer </strong> and a proud part of India’s underground street dance community. Dance has taught me discipline, persistence, and self-expression. I regularly participate in street battles and community events, and I find that the creativity I express through dance often complements my analytical thinking. Whether it's identifying patterns in a dance routine or in a dataset, I approach both with curiosity and precision.</p>

<p>Outside of work and dance, I enjoy immersing myself in music (especially funk, hip hop, rap, and R&B), watching entertainment content, gaming, and exploring the world of art and design. These interests keep me energized and inspired, both creatively and analytically.</p>

<p>I strongly believe in continuous learning and staying open-minded. The world of data is constantly evolving, and I’m committed to evolving with it—upskilling regularly, embracing new tools and techniques, and always seeking to improve. My goal is to contribute to data-driven solutions in real-world business scenarios, and to grow into a role where I can combine my technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving mindset to make a real impact.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I hope my journey resonates with you, and I’m always open to collaborations, mentorship, or meaningful conversations in the world of data and beyond.</p>
